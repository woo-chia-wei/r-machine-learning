# About
This is a machine learning note in R language. It covers following topics:
* [k Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/r-machine-learning/blob/master/k-nearest-neighbours.ipynb) - Traffic signs dataset to predict sign type. (pedestrian, speed, stop).
* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/r-machine-learning/blob/master/naive_bayes.ipynb) - IPhone location to predict location given weekday and daytime. (office, campus, home, ...)
* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/r-machine-learning/blob/master/linear-regression.ipynb) - Boston dataset in MASS to predict median value of homes.
* [Logistics Regression](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/r-machine-learning/blob/master/logistics-regression.ipynb) - SMarket dataset in ISLR to predict stock's return (postive, negative).
